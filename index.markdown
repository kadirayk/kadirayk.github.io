I am a Ph.D. student and work on scaling precise static code analyses on large-scale code bases.  
I am advised by [Eric Bodden](https://bodden.de) at [Paderborn University](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/sse/).

I did my master's at [Paderborn University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn_University) and bachelor's at [Yildiz Technical University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z_Technical_University) with an exchange year at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemnitz_University_of_Technology).

## Resarch Interests

I am interested in static program analysis. More specifically I focus on:

- Optimization techniques for the static analysis of real-world code bases
- Program-specific applications of such optimizations
- Techniques for specifying program analyses

## Projects

### **[SparseBoomerang](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SparseBoomerang)**
[SparseBoomerang](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SparseBoomerang) is the scalable alternative to Boomerang pointer analysis framework.

### **[SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp)**

[SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp) is a new version of good old [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot) framework with a completely overhauled architecture. I am currently leading SootUp's development.

### **[SootFX](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SootFX)**

[SootFX](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SootFX) is a static code feature extraction tool for Java and Android. I have designed it to be easily extensible for supporting new features and arbitrary resource providers.
