I am a Ph.D. student and working as a research assistant in [Eric Bodden's](https://bodden.de)
research group [Secure Software Engineering](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/sse/) at the [Heinz Nixdorf Institut](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/).

 I received a M.Sc. in Computer Science from [Paderborn University](https://uni-paderborn.de).
 Prior to that, I worked as a software engineer at [Turkish Airlines](https://www.turkishairlines.com/).
 I graduated from [Yildiz Technical University](https://www.yildiz.edu.tr/en/) with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, 
 during that I did an exchange year at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/).

## Resarch Interests

I am interested in static program analysis. More specifically I focus on:

- Optimization techniques for the static analysis of real-world code bases
- Program-specific applications of such optimizations
- Techniques for specifying program analyses

## Projects

### **[SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp)**

[SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp) is a new version of [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot) with a completely overhauled architecture. I am currently leading SootUp's development.

### **[SootFX](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SootFX)**

[SootFX](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/SootFX) is a static code feature extraction tool for Java and Android. I have designed it to be easily extensible for supporting new features and arbitrary resource providers.
