### Thesis

Feel free to contact me for your thesis if the following sounds interesting to you.

#### Languages & Tools

- The type of research I am doing requires to be comfortable with Java, as all of the projects that I work with are built with/and for it.
- Most of the implementations are done using the [Soot](https://github.com/soot-oss/soot) framework or can be done using [SootUp](https://github.com/soot-oss/SootUp). So a familiarization with these frameworks are also useful.

#### Research Topics

- Utilizing program features in static analysis. ([SootFx](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9610670))
- DSLs for defining static analyses. ([IncA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2970276.2970298), [Flix](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2980983.2908096))
