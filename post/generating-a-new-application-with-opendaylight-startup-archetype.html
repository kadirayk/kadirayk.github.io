	<h1>Generating a New Application with OpenDaylight Startup Archetype</h1>
	<p>It seems the instructions on the OpenDaylight <a href="https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Controller_Core_Functionality_Tutorials:Application_Development_Tutorial">wiki</a> is outdated as of 19 Aug 2018, 
	and the startup maven archetype is now part of <a href="https://github.com/opendaylight/archetypes">archetypes project</a>. I think previously it was part of the <a href="https://github.com/opendaylight/controller">OpenDaylight Controller</a>.
	I couldn't find any instructions about how to generate maven archetype with the new archetype project, and sort of found my way around to create a new startup application.
	These are the steps I followed:</p>

	<span>Get the archetypes project on your machine, and build the project.</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">git clone https://github.com/opendaylight/archetypes.git</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">cd archetypes</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">mvn -nsu clean install</pre>

<span>Move to a different directory which you want to create the project.</span>

<span>Change the values in the following command for your own project. ("your.group.id", "YourAppName")</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=your.group.id -DartifactId=YourAppName \
-DarchetypeGroupId=org.opendaylight.archetypes \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=opendaylight-startup-archetype</pre>

<span>Then cd into newly created folder which will have the name: "YourAppName". And build the project.</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">mvn -nsu clean install</pre>

<span>After the build you can run karaf to see it is working.</span>
<pre class="prettyprint">cd karaf/target/assembly/bin
./karaf</pre>
