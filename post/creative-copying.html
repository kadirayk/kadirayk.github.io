	<h1>Creative Copying</h1>
	<p>I started playing guitar when I was a high school sophomore. After learning the basics, the next thing to do was to play songs of famous bands.
That process continued until I start university and form my own band to compose our own songs. We had a clear idea of which genre we would belong to.
Then we started playing songs that we liked from that specific genre, and consequently grasped the techniques that were commonly used in the genre.
We found out patterns, and the formulas became clear. After that, we only needed to comply with the formulas, be creative on small blocks that made up the formulas.
And voil√†! We had a genuine song. We are artists.</p>

<p>At the end don't we grow up copying our parents? It seems to be a basic instinct, and a key element of learning.</p>

<p>I often find software development the same. When we try to learn a new paradigm, we start with copying a basic application, usually from a tutorial. 
Then the story is the same, we change the tiny bits that make up the application. We create a completely new application, which is completely original, and yet only 
a creative copy of some other.</p>

<p>While I believe copying is not a bad thing, in fact it is essentially important for growth, I also belive that it shouldn't be the last step in the process of creativity. 
One should also cross the boundries of the formulas, create new formulas, and even things that can not be formulated.</p>
